# Formats
Data are provided as **[CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)**. At the server, these data is converted to and handled as R structures (dataframes). As mentioned above, validation happens in the client browser, using Javascript code. Accordingly the data, together with the schemas are sent back to the client as a **[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)** text. This information is converted at the client into Javascript objects which can be handled by abovementioned Javascript validation library `ajv`. Likewise, the validation result is shipped back as a JSON string which gets parsed back into R structures at the server.
