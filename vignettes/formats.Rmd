# Formats
- Data are uploaded as **[CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)**.
- At the server, these data is converted to and handled as R structures (dataframes).
- Validation* happens in the client's browser, based on the **[ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) library**. To this purpose, data and validation results are shipped in **[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)** format between server and browser
