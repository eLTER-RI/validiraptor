## Installation and usage

### Installation from GitHub
This **R** package ist available from GitHub only. Use {remotes} or {pacman}
to install from GitHub:

```
  ## install {remotes} if necessary:
  if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
  ## fetch and install {validiraptor}:
  remotes::install_github("eLTER-RI/validiraptor")
```

## Notes for contributors

### Dependencies
- Dependencies on other R packages are declared in `DESCRIPTION` and resolved
 upon installation.
- Javascript dependencies are declared and included in
 `inst\app\www\js`


*To modify the javascript part of the validation functionality,
    change the source `validate.src.js` first,
    then [`browserify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify)
    the source to get the bundled `validate.js`*




### Coding standards

To maintain the quality and readability of our code, we follow certain
coding standards. Contributors are expected to adhere to these
guidelines when writing code for this project:

#### Style

-   Our R code adheres to the [tidyverse style
    guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). Key points include:
    -   Name variables and functions in `snake_case`
(except `camelCase` for IDs of Shiny UI elements)
    -   Place spaces around all binary operators (=, +, -, \<-, etc.),
        except in function arguments.
    -   Always assign `<-`, not `=`

#### Approach
-   Those coming from an object oriented language (like Python), please
    observe R's [functional approach](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html)
    together with the native pipe operator `|>` to prevent scope mess.


<!-- general advice for contributors, include in README ?

### Tools for enforcing style

-   R packages to support styling (and other code checks) are
    [`lintr`](https://lintr.r-lib.org/) or
    [`styler`](https://styler.r-lib.org/). RStudio and other
    popular code editors also offer R-specific linting modes/plugins.

## Data standards

This project adheres to eLTER data standards. Please ensure all data
complies with these standards (*e. g. by using this package*)
    and is deposited appropriately in
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/elter) or
[B2SHARE](https://b2share.eudat.eu/communities/LTER) repositories as per
eLTER community guidelines.



## File naming nomenclature

To ensure clarity and ease of access for all contributors, please adhere
to the following file naming conventions:

-   Use descriptive names that reflect the content or purpose of the
    file.
-   Use underscores (\_) to separate different elements of R source file names
    (`awesome_function.R`) as well as to denote spaces within
    an element (`my_important_dataframe`)
-   Keep file names concise, avoiding unnecessary abbreviations while
    maintaining sufficient detail. 
    [Here's how to name R source files](https://r-pkgs.org/code.html#sec-code-organising)


## Reproducibility

Ensure the reproducibility of your work by:

-   Providing detailed descriptions of methods and protocols in the
    documentation.
-   Including version-controlled source code for all scripts and
    analysis workflows.
-   Specifying versions and sources of external libraries and tools
    used.
-   Sharing raw data and processed results in accessible, referenced
    data repositories with clear metadata.
-   Documenting any deviations from the expected protocols.

## Contributing

The repository should have clear instructions on how to contribute to
the project. This should include different files with clear
instructions. To do so, add a folder named `.github` on the project
root. In this folder you should add the following files:

-   `CONTRIBUTING.md`
-   `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
-   `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
-   `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
-   `BUG_REPORT.md`
-   `FEATURE_REQUEST.md`
